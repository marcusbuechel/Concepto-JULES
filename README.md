# Concepto-JULES

Concepto-JULES is a set of bash scripts to enable JULES (https://jules.jchmr.org/) to run river catchments as a single point.

This code was initially written as part of the Advanced Scripting Course run by the University of Manchester.

## CAUTION:

This is still work in progress and has not been finished to run on all user accounts.
You need a JASMIN (http://jasmin.ac.uk/) user account to run Concepto-JULES.
